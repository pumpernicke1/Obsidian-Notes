- Taxonomic Classification
	-  It is interesting how marine mammals are so different from fish but through evolution they could have easily been classified as fish.
	- Despite all belonging to the marine mammal family and all of them being similar, they are not even closely related to eachother. Seals are more closely related to dogs than manatees.
	- These orders that are genetically unrelated developed many similar survival strategies. This is all because of evolution
- Evolutionary Perspectives
	- Lamarck's (outdated): Beneficial traits arise from certain needs, such as giraffes growing longer necks in order to eat leaves on tall trees
	- Darwin-Wallace: Variation exists within groups, and animals with beneficial variations are more likely to survive and reproduce, causing these beneficial traits to propagate throughout the species
	- Not every trait has a purpose
	- Although Lamarck was wrong, his idea of inheritance was an important contribution to the theory of evolution
	- Both agree that evolution relies on environment since certain traits are beneficial for certain situations
	- Initial theories did not know how this variation was occuring
	- Mutation is the cause of inheritance
-  Evolution and Ancestry
	- If we were to group families without any prior knowledge, it might make sense to group animals that can fly, swim, and walk into different groups. But if this was the case, a butterfly would be in the same family as a bat.
	- Environment is what creates similar traits between distantly related species, because selective pressures are the same
	- Adaptive radiations: After dinosaur extinction, mammals radiated dramatically filling all ninches the dinosaurs used to fill.
- Convergent Adaptations
	- Although the orders of marine mammals are distantly related and all entered the water at different points in time, they all faced similar selective pressures
		- Thermoregulation
		- Difficulty moving in the water
		- Being unable to breathe underwater
- Sirenians
	- A single mutation in the PITX1 gene is responsible for the development of lower limbs better suited for water
- Cetaceans
	- There are two seperate instances of cetacean orders losing their teeth (transitioning from odontoceti to mysticeti) despite the lineages being unrelated
		- This is another example of convergent adaptation
- Pinnipeds
	- Pinnipeds lost a lot of genes that are otherwise vital to land-dwelling mammals
