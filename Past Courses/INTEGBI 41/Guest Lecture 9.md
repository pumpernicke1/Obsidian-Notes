-Learning objectives helped me focus on what to take away from the lecture
- Cool to know that pinnipeds could have originated somewhere along the West Coast
- Diversification came after the closing of oceans
- 5 majorn steps to feeding
- remove water from the food
- three types of feeding strategies: biting, suction, filter feedingpharyngeal arch present in all mammals
- interesting how for the case of homdonty, the evolution became less complex rather than more
- Its cool how technology is being sued to answer questions that may not be obvious through simple observation (digitizing of skulls)
- How could these takeaways be used in other fields maybe engineering
- Heterodonty seems more versatile so its surprising how homodonty is still around maybe because they are better at fulfilling their niche
- More dedicated suctioner stellar seals have smaller gape than more versatile suctionfeeder like fur seals
	- They also create more suction with their throats but I dont see what the tradeoff here is Im surprised the fur seal wouldn't be able to create a lot of suction either gular compression
- Grazing is the same whether youre on land or on water
- Beach bear wasnt like a bear or an otter but more like a sabre tooth tiger
