- Haul-outs: Locations on land where seals gather to rest, give birth, care for pups, molt
- Annual Life cycle
	- pupping and breeding  spring to summer
	- molting and dispersal summer
	- Winter foraging 
- Birth sequence
	- females give birth to one pup/year
	- pups swim at birth
	- females wean pups at 30 days
	- pups double in size to 50lb after just one month
- Monitoring methods
	- Tracking shark bites
	- Harbor seal fur can turn red the iron in their fur i s literally rusting
	- decline in pup count and they don;t know why
	- No real pup decline during the breeding season but lower counts during molting season
	- Are they dying or are they moving somewhere we can't track
	- Funding is important
- elephant seals
	- Males weigh 5000 lbs
- Harbor seals swim day one but elephant seals don't why is this? Elephant seals have to learn all this on their own the mother is gone
- side note: super weaner very funny
- climate change and increasing tide, less places to breed increase in winter storms
- Tracking: tagging pups collaborating with researchers across the USU and Mexico
- dip in number of pups last year due to winter storms.
