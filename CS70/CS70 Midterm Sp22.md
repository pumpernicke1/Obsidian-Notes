2. Warmup: There are 70 people. An even number of them wear one shoe. One-half of the remainder wear no shoes, and the rest wear two shoes. How many shoes are worn in total by the 70 people?
	1. Answer: $Shoes = 2k + 2(70-2k/2) + 0(70-2k/2)$
		$Shoes = 2k + 2(70-2k/2) $
		Shoes = 2k + 70 - 2k
		Shoes = 70$
