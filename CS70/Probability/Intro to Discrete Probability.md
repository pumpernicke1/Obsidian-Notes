- Why is Discrete Probability Important?
	- Discrete probability will come in handy when working with AI, algorithms, signal processing, and systems so make sure to pay attention!
- Probability Spaces
	- Probability spaces are represented by a sample space $\Omega$ and a probability $P |\omega|$    representing the probability sampling each element in $\Omega$ 
	- The sample space consists of all possible outcomes (and even some that aren't possible, such as an option with a probability of 0)
		- For example, a coin toss would have a sample space of {H, T} since those are the two options
	- The probability is represented by an equation, most often $P[\omega] = \frac{1}{N}$ representing uniform odds for all elements to be drawn
	- There are two criterion for a valid probability space
		1. (Non-negativity): No possibility will have a chance of less than 0 or more than 1. This is represented as $\forall\omega\in\Omega(0 \leq P[\omega] \leq 1)$ 
		2. (Total one) The sum of all probabilities is equal to 1 $\sum P[\omega]=1$
