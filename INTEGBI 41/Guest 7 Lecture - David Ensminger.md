- Although we know that different marine mammals are very distantly related, I was surprised to learn that there is a vast seperation of lineages when it came to different kinds of seals
- It is interesting to learn how elephant seals were hunted after whale populations starting thinning out instead of deciding to slow down
- All modern elephant seals originate from only 20 initial elephant seals after a devastating period of hunting
- It is interesting how there are different foraging zones based on their needs but also surprising males dont protect the females
- Offtopic but the little gps on their heads  is actually so cute
- only spend 2 minutes breathing for over an hour and a half underwater need a lot less time on the surface than other species like sperm whales
- time at surface should increase after each subsequent dive since more lactic acid is building up
- Very efficient swimmers gliding a lot to prserve oxygen
- Very oxygen efficient systems to over 9% whereas we would pass out at 15-20% oxygen
- Interesting how even after decades of research there are things we don't know about elephant seals such as how they can function under so much underwater pressure
- up to 50 pups for one male
- SEAGULLS EAT SEALS???
- benefits of capital breeding
- why  invest in a large pup?
	- No impact of weight on survivorship?
		- Answer still not sure
		- Could possibly help pups leave land longer to get better foraging conditions
- Interesting how they can just know when to claim territory and when to seek eachothers' touch based on the time of the year
- Stress impacts testosterone of males
- Dangers of research interesting how they get more hands on than lets say sarah codde at point reyes
